## Project Description
The aim of this project is to analyze the sentiment of tweets related to COVID-19 using two pre-trained language models, DistilBERT and RoBERTa. The app takes in user-generated text input (tweet) and predicts whether the sentiment of the tweet is Negative, Neutral, or Positive. The app also preprocesses the input text by replacing any mention of usernames with "@user" and replacing any URLs with "http".

How the app works

- Select the model type from the dropdown list. You can choose between DistilBERT and RoBERTa.
- Type your tweet or text in the text area provided.
- Click on the "Analyze" button to get the sentiment analysis of your input text.
