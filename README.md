## Screenshot / GIF of the application (Demo)



## Application Description (One Line)
- The project is a machine learning model that can generate natural language text based on a given prompt. The model is based on the state-of-the-art GPT-3 architecture and has been fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data. The model is hosted on the Hugging Face Model Hub, which provides easy access to the model through a RESTful API.

- The project also includes a Dockerfile that can be used to deploy the model locally or in a cloud environment. The Dockerfile installs the necessary dependencies and sets up the environment to run the model. Additionally, the project includes documentation and examples to help users get started with using the model.

- Overall, the project aims to make it easy for developers and data scientists to use and deploy a powerful natural language generation model in their applications.

## 4. Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Clone the repository to your local machine:


        git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git

Navigate to the project directory:

        cd your-project
Create a new virtual environment and activate the virtual:

- Windows:

        python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

- Linux & MacOs:

        python3 -m venv ve  nv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt



Copy code
python app.py
Once the Gradio interface is running, you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:7860.

## Configuration Setup
Alongside installation, you may have some configuration files that are necessary to setup for each person. Add notes here about config options and what they need to change

## 6. Usage <a name="usage"></a>
- The app will start running and display a Gradio interface with input fields and a submit button.
- Enter the input text in the input field and click the submit button.
- The app will generate the output based on the input and display it in the output field.
- You can continue entering new inputs and getting new outputs as desired.
- When you are finished using the app, you can close the Gradio interface or terminate the app by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal/command prompt.
